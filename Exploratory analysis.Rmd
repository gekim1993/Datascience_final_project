  # for obesity.

For obesity, Manhattan has lowerest percentage. Bronx has the highest. And there are increasing obesity percentages as the order of Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. For diabetes, the lowest and highest are the same as those of obesity. The difference is that the percentages of Queens and Staten Island are nearly the same and a little bit lower than that of Brooklyn. For stroke, it has the same situation with that of diabetes.
